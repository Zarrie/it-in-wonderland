# About the Author

Hi, I'm Viktor.

I'm a Software Engineer, CS Bachelor, and Aspiring Entrepreneur.

I love solving problems and building user-first products, and I usually do it using Python or Golang on AWS.
My expertise spans across Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, and Algorithms.

After getting on the management track, I am quite interested in people and organizations as well.

I also have a cat! üêà

Always feel free to contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zarrie/) as it is the only social network I'm active on.

*Thanks for reading!*
