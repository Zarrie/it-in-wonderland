  <h1 class="post-title">My Favorite Books</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>I believe a good book is a treasure, and all the good books I have read deserve their place on this page to be easy to find for me and everyone else.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="inspired-how-to-create-products-customers-love"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3323374-inspired">Inspired: How To Create Products Customers Love</a></h2>

<p>An amazing book on building great products as a single founder, or in a big corp, about innovation, marketing, and management - definitely changed my perspective on business.</p>

<h2 id="no-rules-rules-netflix-and-the-culture-of-reinvention"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49099937-no-rules-rules">No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention</a></h2>

<p>After reading that book my perspective on building a strong team, enabling innovation, and building trust changed completely.
Engineers, Managers and even Executives can benefit a lot from reading that book.</p>

<h2 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things-building-a-business-when-there-are-no-easy-answers"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers</a></h2>

<p>I don’t think I learned anything particular from that book, but I think I grew up a bit reading it. It’s one of that books you want to read at least once in your life.
The candor that Horowitz talks with changes your perspective.</p>

<h2 id="the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant-a-guide-to-wealth-and-happiness"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54898389-the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness</a></h2>

<p>Everyone who knows me also knows how inspiring I think Naval is.
This book really synthesizes his wisdom and experience, and I think this is all that has to be said for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-7-day-startup-you-dont-learn-until-you-launch"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23290805-the-7-day-startup">The 7 Day Startup: You Don’t Learn Until You Launch</a></h2>

<p>As a Software Engineer, I easily find myself chasing perfection and polishing my work infinitely. This book helped me address that.
This book serves as a great calibration tool for entrepreneurs who are also Engineers and makers.</p>

<h2 id="the-lean-startup-how-todays-entrepreneurs-use-continuous-innovation-to-create-radically-successful-businesses"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup">The Lean Startup: How Today’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses</a></h2>

<p>A bit more theoretical and hard to read startups classic, which in my opinion, changed the way people bootstrap and build startups in the last years, which makes the effort of reading it worth it.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-thing-the-surprisingly-simple-truth-behind-extraordinary-results"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16256798-the-one-thing">The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results</a></h2>

<p>I used to be ( unfortunately still am from time to time) a multitasker, and this book really changed my perspective on prioritization and time management.
In a world full of opportunities this book is an amazing tool to help you keep a sharp focus on your goals.</p>

<h2 id="the-managers-path-a-guide-for-tech-leaders-navigating-growth-and-change"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path">The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change</a></h2>

<p>I speed-read that book the weekend before my first day as a line manager, and I must admit it made my life easier.
It’s the only book that talks about management in a simple constructive way, making you feel a bit more confident and demystifying the subject without unnecessarily romanticizing it.</p>

<h2 id="deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a></h2>

<p>After I graduated from University I gradually stopped having deep focused time for work.
Work, life, and all Other distractions really helped that.
This book opened my eyes to that and helped me learn how to prevent that and have quality time for deep work when needed.</p>
